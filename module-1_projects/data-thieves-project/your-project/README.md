## Project Description
We chose to review bike sharing options in different cities worldwide. We therefore considered the city, in which the companies are present and with another, much bigger dataframe, we managed to add additional information to the previous one.

## Questions & Hypotheses
We want to display the bike sharing companies which are the most present with their business.<br/>
We want to figure out, which cities have the most bike sharing opportunities and if those cities are the ones with the highest population density.<br/>
Premirilary, we assumed, that it is possible, that the more populated cities have less options, because it also depends on the infrastructure, the city offers for bicycles. So it could be, that they can't be used everywhere in high intensity.

## Dataset
The sources used are attached below.<br/>
We used an open API and a csv-Datafile from kaggle.<br/>
While selecting data, it was important to us, that geographical data is provided, to be able, to make further investigations based on this in the future. <br/>
**Bike Sharing API:** <br/>
This dataset had the following columns: <br/>
* city
* country
* latitude
* longitude
* company
* href
* id
* name <br/>
It has the shape (640, 8).

**Population Dataset:** 
      

**Population Dataset from Kaggle:** <br/>
What dataset (or datasets) did you use? What are the different sources you used (e.g. APIs, web scrapping, etc.)? Provide links to the data if available and describe the data briefly.

## Database
What is the structure of your database? Have you created more than one table and if yes, how are they related to each other?

## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What are the steps you went through?

## Organization
How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a kanban board?

What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.

## Links
Include links to your repository, slides and kanban board. Feel free to include any other links associated with your project.
